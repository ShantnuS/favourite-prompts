A collection of my favourite prompts for ChatGPT

## Productivity 

#### Writing Colleague Feedback
_"I need to write feedback for a colleague. Can you ask me a series of 5 questions one by one and then use my responses to generate feedback?"_

Feel free to ask further prompts such as _"Can you make this longer and less formal?"_ or _"For each of the positives can you tell me how my colleague can use this further?"_

#### Creating Slides
_"I need to explain the concept of `Insert Concept Here` in one slide of a presentation with as few words as possible. The audience are complete beginners so it doesn't need to be advanced. What should I include in the slide?"_
